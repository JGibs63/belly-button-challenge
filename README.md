# belly-button-challenge
In this challenge, I was given a dataset from "https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/" about belly button biodiversity. With this data, I used JavaScript to create a horizontal bar chart, as well as a bubble chart, detailing the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were present within each individual.

You can find the data here: file:///Users/joshuagibson/Desktop/ClassWork/VU-VIRT-DATA-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC/lesson/14-Interactive-Visualizations/belly-button-challenge/Data/index.html
