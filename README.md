# belly-button-challenge
In this challenge, I was given a dataset from "https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/" about belly button biodiversity. With this data, I used JavaScript to create a horizontal bar chart, as well as a bubble chart, detailing the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were present within each individual.
